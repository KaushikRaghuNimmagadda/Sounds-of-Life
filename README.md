# Sounds-of-Life
Play Conway's game of life while also listening to some interesting tones! This project was mostly an exercise in
learning kotlin, but I've found that it also makes nice background music for studying!

## Some features that might be added if I have time
* Load gamestates from files
* Placing some common Methuselahs by default
* Making the front end actually pretty
